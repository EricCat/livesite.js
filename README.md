Introduction
============

LiveSite is web framework developed for node.js with fully featured inline editing. 

The philosophy of LiveSite is: remove all admin panels and just do the edinting inline! We provide you with a filesystem tree where all files are loaded automatically and a versatile plugin system to make your code as modular as possible. 

To run livesite you will need node.js: 
	apt-get install node

Then run the bootstrap script in the livesite directory to install all of the dependencies. 

Then create a new mysql database. 

Then run: 
node server.js in the livesite directory

Sorry, very little docs have been written at the moment. More will come..
